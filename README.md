# CoD-VPN-Patcher
Patches OpenVPN Profiles (.ovpn) to CoD VPN profiles.

# Warining
This is something I've put together in a few minutes! It probably works with most/all OpenVPN profiles but that is not guaranteed. Use it at your own risk!

## Installation
1. Download this repository as .zip
2. Extract the folder and drag it somewhere it belongs (e.g. your programs folder)
3. (optional) For easier access you can create a shortcut for the .bat file and put it on your Desktop
4. Download .ovpn file of your VPN provider
5. Drag .ovpn over the "CoD VPN Patcher.bat" file or the shortcut
6. A new file will be created with the name "\<original file name>_CoD_VPN.opvn"
7. Import the new VPN file to OpenVPN
8. Profit?

## Requirements
1. A VPN provider that offers .ovpn files to download (e.g. NordVPN)
2. The newest version of [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/)
3. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.9 or higher, check your Python version by opening a Terminal and typing "python --version" (only tested on python 3.11.6, should work tho)
